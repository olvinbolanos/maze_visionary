## Project

## Introduction

In this game, the user would be able to move around the keys and move through the maze and find their exit at the end of the maze. In fact, as the user moves along each path, they will earn points and there would also be a time limit to complete each game. Most of this game would be developed in javascript, with nodeJS to render my files through HTTP. This would be my first time using a canvas. However, it would just be for design purposes and not for anything else in particular.

This game would help me further my development as a programmer and I would like to start a new project. 

##Set Up

1. There will be a maze.js file that would be taking in parameters to know where the user would be starting at and where they would be ending at. 

2. The player would have to be built on a seperate javascript page and it would be a class where the player would have health, hungry, and a location finder to know where exactly the player is at on the canvas.

## Instructions
 - The user must use a server side network «« meaning that the only way this game could be run is if the user runs this game on a network connection througg the server in order for the game to check the data on the canvas because of a little method called getImageData() that only works on servers.

 - On here, run nodemon in the console.

 - The user must follow the correct path of  the maze and not hit a wall or they will be deducted a point from there health.

- Solving these mazes takes time and effort, hope you have a fun time doing just that.
